        "*   Goal: predict popularity of hip-hop songs based on audio features, lyrics, and background information\n",
        "*   Spotify API has a metric for each track called \"Popularity\" which ranges from 0-100. We use this to determine Popularity categories for each song i.e. low, medium or high (which we define later mathematically). The goal is to predict the popularity category. \n",
        "*   We use the Spotify API to collect input features including audio features; MusixMatch API for lyrics; webscraping for early-life background info from wikipedia. \n",
        "*   Instead of using an existing dataset, we created our own. We made 2 playlists on my own Spotify account, one with popular hiphop songs and one with underrated/not as popular/up and coming songs. We took these from existing playlists with similar names. We then created a function to extract audio features from the spotify api for each track in the playlist and then concatenated the dataframes row-wise to have one big playlist. \n",
        "*   This way, we were able to bypass the API's 100 song limit per playlist and this can even be extended in the future for as many songs as needed. \n",
